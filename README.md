# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

The problem AmbuSaver solves
Swift Access to Emergency Services: It addresses the challenge of timely access to emergency medical services by providing a convenient online platform for booking ambulances. This ensures that users can quickly request assistance during medical emergencies without the need for lengthy phone calls or waiting on hold.
Rapid Access to Healthcare Facilities: By leveraging GPS technology to pinpoint the user's location, the platform can quickly identify the nearest hospital.
Real-Time Resource Availability: The platform provides valuable information on the total number of ambulances stationed at the nearest hospital. This data enables users to assess the availability of emergency medical transportation resources in their vicinity, empowering them to make informed decisions when booking an ambulance.
Efficient Resource Allocation: By allowing users to book ambulances directly, the platform helps in optimizing the allocation of available emergency resources. It ensures that ambulances are dispatched effectively to where they are needed most, reducing response times and improving overall emergency medical service efficiency.
Accessibility and Convenience: The platform enhances accessibility to emergency medical services, particularly for individuals with limited mobility or those residing in remote areas. By offering an easy-to-use online booking system, it ensures that anyone with internet access can quickly request ambulance assistance, regardless of their location or time of day.

Challenges I ran into
Privacy Concerns: Addressing privacy concerns related to user location tracking while ensuring compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA might have required careful consideration and implementation of privacy safeguards.
Data Accuracy and Reliability: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of location data and hospital information, especially in dynamic environments with frequent changes in ambulance availability or hospital statuses, may have required robust data validation and synchronization mechanisms.
User Adoption and Education: Educating users about the benefits and functionalities of the platform, as well as addressing any concerns or misconceptions related to privacy, security, and data usage, might have been necessary to ensure widespread adoption and usage.
